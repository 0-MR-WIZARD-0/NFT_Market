            <p>NFT, a non-fungible token, is a non—interchangeable token, that is, a unique record in the blockchain — a decentralized database, which also stores the history of operations with a specific token.
    The main feature of NFT is the impossibility of replacing, substituting and changing information. This makes it an ideal tool for confirming ownership of a digital asset. In fact, buying an NFT, the buyer receives a certificate of authenticity and ownership of a specific work. Such a purchase can be compared, for example, with the purchase of a painting exhibited on a permanent basis in a gallery.
    Our marketplace will allow absolutely everyone to sell and buy NFT (we do not take commissions)</p>
